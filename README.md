# XPC123
 XPC easy as 123, XPC it's you and me!

Made these example two apps of a mach service that works with both Application clients and command line utilities. 

Started with Apple's XPC Service template with Swift, but Apple's does not work with external applications making it a reason to abandon their approach.

By converting it to a mach service with very little code changes, this allows any app or cli to use the mach service.

I've included both a mach service and a client. Tried to make this as easy as possible and kept it similar to Apple's template.

I am sure there is much more to XPC than this, however having a working example on both the client and server makes it worth XPC gold.

Hope this becomes useful to anyone wanting to use XPC across their own apps. Enjoy!
