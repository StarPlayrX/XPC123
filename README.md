# XPC123
 XPC Easy as 123, XPC It's you and me

Made these example apps of a MachService that works with both Applications clients and command line utilitites. 

Started with Apple's XPC Service template with Swift, but Apple's does not work with external applications making it become a reason to abandon their approach.

By converting it to a mach service with very little code changes allows any app or cli to use the mach service.

I've included both a mach service and a client. Tried to make this a easy as possible and keep it similar to Apple's template.

I am sure there is much more to XPC than this, however having a 100% work example on both the client and server makes sense.

Hope this becomes useful to anyone wanting to use XPC across their own apps. Enjoy!
